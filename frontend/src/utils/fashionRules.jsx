    description:
      "The Sandwich Method helps create visually balanced outfits by layering a base color close to the body, a contrasting middle layer, and a final accent color. It works well for shirts with jackets, scarves, or outerwear. Echoing colors across layers guides the eye smoothly from top to bottom, avoiding disjointed looks. For example, a white shirt, navy blazer, and burgundy scarf create harmony and depth.",

    title: "High Waist = Taller Look",
    description:
      "High-waisted bottoms create the illusion of longer legs and a taller silhouette. Pairing them with a tucked-in, cropped, or fitted top emphasizes this effect. Lighter tops and darker bottoms draw attention upward, visually elongating the body. This styling trick is ideal for petite individuals or anyone wanting balanced proportions without relying on heels, making your outfit appear polished and more flattering naturally.",

    title: "Limit the Colors",
    description:
      "Limiting your outfit to two or three main colors maintains visual clarity and cohesion. Additional shades should appear only as subtle accents. Using neutrals like black, white, or beige as the base allows brighter shades to add personality without overwhelming the look. This principle is useful for everyday wear, work outfits, or minimalistic styles where clean, coordinated, and sophisticated appearances matter most.",

    title: "Balance Silhouettes",
    description:
      "Balancing silhouettes ensures no part of your outfit appears too heavy. Pair oversized or loose tops with fitted bottoms, or tight tops with wide or flowy pants or skirts. This creates proportion and keeps outfits flattering. The contrast between fitted and loose pieces helps define your shape while maintaining style and comfort, preventing boxy or shapeless looks when experimenting with oversized or relaxed trends.",

    title: "Vertical Lines = Slimming",
    description:
      "Vertical lines and patterns draw the eye up and down, elongating the body and creating a slimmer appearance. This includes stripes, seams, pleats, or long open layers. Horizontal lines, by contrast, emphasize width. Incorporating vertical elements, especially with dark colors, enhances a streamlined silhouette and balances fuller shapes. This technique works well in casual and formal outfits, providing subtle yet effective styling benefits.",

    title: "Neutral Base, Bold Accent",
    description:
      "Using a neutral base with a bold accent allows you to experiment with color safely. Neutral shades like grey, beige, or navy provide a calm foundation, while one bold accessory such as a bag, belt, shoes, or jewelry adds personality. This method ensures the accent stands out clearly without competing with other elements, making it ideal for beginners or professional looks that want polish and visual interest.",

    title: "Monochrome Magic",
    description:
      "Monochrome dressing uses shades of a single color to create a clean, cohesive look. Mixing light and dark tones or varying textures adds depth while keeping the outfit visually elongating. This technique avoids harsh color breaks, helping the eye move smoothly from top to bottom. It works for both casual and formal outfits, and is especially effective with neutrals or softer hues like blues and browns for a sophisticated effect.",

    title: "Accessorize Smartly",
    description:
      "Accessories enhance an outfit without overpowering it. One or two statement pieces, like bold necklaces or earrings, maintain focus and balance. Over-accessorizing can distract from the clothing itself. Matching accessories to your color palette keeps the look cohesive, while still allowing personality to shine. Thoughtful accessory choices elevate simple outfits with minimal effort, ensuring each element contributes intentionally to the overall style.",

    title: "Contrast Lengths",
    description:
      "Contrasting lengths create proportion and visual interest. Short tops with high-waisted bottoms draw attention to the waist and lengthen legs, while long tops with low-rise bottoms can shorten the appearance of the legs. This approach highlights your best features and balances the body, making outfits look modern, flattering, and stylish without sacrificing comfort.",

      "Color blocking divides an outfit into clear sections to create a structured, bold look. Limiting blocks to two or three shades prevents overload, while harmonious contrasts ensure the outfit feels intentional. Clean lines, simple silhouettes, and neutral accessories balance strong colors, making this technique perfect for experimenting with vibrant shades without sacrificing polish or wearability.",

      "Proper fit is more important than trends. Well-fitted clothing enhances your shape, improves comfort, and makes any outfit look refined. Clothes that are too tight or loose can appear uncomfortable or sloppy. Choosing cuts that flatter your body type and tailoring garments elevates your wardrobe, emphasizing confidence, comfort, and timeless style over fleeting fashion.",

Neutral or darker solids help ground patterns and create cohesion. This approach keeps prints stylish and balanced, ensuring your look feels intentional rather than chaotic.",
