    title: "Sandwich Method",
    description:
      "The Sandwich Method is a classic styling principle that helps create a visually balanced and intentional outfit. The idea is to divide your look into three layers: a base color closest to your body, a contrasting or complementary middle layer, and a final accent color on top. This technique works especially well for layered outfits such as shirts with jackets, scarves, or outerwear. By repeating or echoing colors at different levels of your outfit, you guide the eye smoothly from top to bottom, avoiding a disjointed look. For example, pairing a white shirt as your base, a navy blazer as the middle layer, and a burgundy scarf or bag as the top accent creates harmony and depth. This method is particularly useful when styling neutrals or experimenting with bold accessories without overwhelming the outfit.",

    title: "High Waist = Taller Look",
    description:
      "High-waisted clothing is one of the easiest ways to create the illusion of height and longer legs. When pants, skirts, or shorts sit higher on your waist, they visually shift your body’s proportions by raising the starting point of your legs. This makes your lower body appear longer and your overall silhouette taller and leaner. Pairing high-waisted bottoms with a tucked-in top, cropped top, or fitted shirt enhances this effect even more. Choosing lighter or brighter colors for the top and darker shades for the bottom helps draw attention upward while keeping the lower half streamlined. This rule is especially helpful for petite individuals or anyone looking to balance proportions and achieve a polished, elongated look without relying on heels.",

    title: "Limit the Colors",
    description:
      "Limiting the number of colors in an outfit helps maintain visual clarity and sophistication. When too many bold or unrelated colors are worn together, the outfit can feel chaotic and distracting rather than stylish. A good rule of thumb is to stick to two or three main colors and allow any additional shades to appear only as subtle accents. This approach ensures that each element of your outfit complements the others instead of competing for attention. Neutrals such as black, white, beige, or grey can be used as grounding colors, while one or two brighter shades can add personality. This principle is particularly useful for everyday wear, work outfits, or minimalistic styles where clean lines and cohesion matter most.",

    title: "Balance Silhouettes",
    description:
      "Balancing silhouettes is all about creating proportion in your outfit so that no single area looks too heavy or overwhelming. If you wear an oversized or loose-fitting top, pairing it with fitted or structured bottoms keeps the look grounded and flattering. On the other hand, a tight or tailored top looks best when balanced with wider or flowy bottoms such as palazzos, wide-leg jeans, or skirts. This contrast helps define your shape while maintaining comfort and style. Ignoring silhouette balance can make an outfit look boxy or shapeless. This rule is especially useful when experimenting with oversized trends, layering, or relaxed fits, ensuring that your outfit still feels intentional and well-composed.",

    title: "Vertical Lines = Slimming",
    description:
      "Vertical lines and patterns naturally draw the eye up and down, creating an elongating effect that can make the body appear slimmer and taller. This includes vertical stripes, seams, button plackets, pleats, or even long open layers like cardigans and jackets. Because the eye follows the vertical direction, the width of the body appears visually reduced. In contrast, horizontal lines emphasize width and can make areas appear broader. Incorporating vertical elements is especially helpful for creating a streamlined look or balancing fuller silhouettes. Dark colors combined with vertical detailing further enhance this effect, making this rule a powerful styling tool for both casual and formal outfits.",

    title: "Neutral Base, Bold Accent",
    description:
      "Using a neutral base with a bold accent is a timeless styling technique that allows you to experiment with color without overpowering your outfit. Neutral shades like grey, beige, white, black, or navy create a calm foundation that feels elegant and versatile. Adding a single bold-colored accessory—such as a bag, shoes, belt, or jewelry—introduces personality and visual interest. This approach ensures that the accent stands out clearly instead of competing with other colors. It is especially effective for beginners who want to incorporate brighter shades into their wardrobe gradually. This rule also works well in professional or minimalist settings where subtlety and polish are important.",

    title: "Monochrome Magic",
    description:
      "Monochrome dressing involves styling an outfit using different shades, tones, or textures of a single color. This technique creates a clean, cohesive look that feels sophisticated and visually elongating. Because there are no harsh color breaks, the eye moves smoothly from head to toe, making the wearer appear taller and more put-together. To avoid looking flat or boring, it’s important to mix light and dark shades or incorporate different fabrics such as denim, cotton, or leather. Monochrome outfits are ideal for both casual and formal settings and work particularly well with neutral colors as well as softer hues like blues or browns.",

    title: "Accessorize Smartly",
    description:
      "Accessories play a crucial role in completing an outfit, but they should enhance your look rather than overpower it. Choosing one or two statement accessories—such as a bold necklace, earrings, watch, or bag—helps maintain balance and focus. Over-accessorizing can make an outfit look cluttered and distract from the clothing itself. Matching accessories loosely with your outfit’s color palette ensures cohesion without looking overly coordinated. This rule encourages intentional styling, where each accessory has a purpose. Accessories are also a great way to express personality and elevate simple outfits, making them feel more styled and complete with minimal effort.",

    title: "Contrast Lengths",
    description:
      "Contrasting lengths within an outfit helps create strong proportions and visual interest. Pairing a shorter top with high-waisted pants, skirts, or shorts draws attention to the waist and makes the legs appear longer. This technique naturally balances the upper and lower body, creating a flattering silhouette. Wearing long tops with low-rise bottoms, on the other hand, can shorten the appearance of the legs. This rule is especially effective for casual outfits, summer wear, and layering looks. Playing with lengths allows you to highlight your best features while maintaining comfort and modern style.",

    title: "Color Block with Care",
    description:
      "Color blocking involves dividing an outfit into clear sections of color to create a bold yet structured look. When done carefully, it can feel modern, artistic, and intentional. Limiting color blocks to two or three shades helps maintain clarity and prevents visual overload. Choosing colors that complement or contrast harmoniously is key to making this technique successful. Clean lines, simple silhouettes, and neutral accessories help balance strong color blocks. This rule is perfect for experimenting with brighter colors while keeping the overall outfit polished and wearable.",

      "No matter how trendy a piece of clothing is, proper fit will always matter more than fashion trends. Well-fitted clothing enhances your natural shape, improves comfort, and instantly makes an outfit look more refined. Clothes that are too tight can appear uncomfortable, while overly loose garments may look unstructured or sloppy. Understanding your body type and choosing cuts that flatter you is more valuable than following every trend. Tailoring even simple garments can significantly elevate your wardrobe. This rule emphasizes confidence, comfort, and timeless style over fast-changing fashion cycles.",

    title: "Patterns in Moderation",
    description:
      "Patterns can add excitement and personality to an outfit, but using them in moderation is essential for a balanced look. Pairing one patterned piece with solid-colored items allows the pattern to stand out without overwhelming the outfit. Mixing too many patterns or bold prints can make the look feel busy and uncoordinated. Neutral or darker solids help ground patterned garments and create harmony. This rule is especially helpful when styling prints such as florals, stripes, or geometric designs. Thoughtful pattern placement ensures your outfit feels stylish rather than chaotic.",

    description:
      "Shoes have the power to transform an entire outfit and should be chosen thoughtfully. A simple or neutral outfit can be elevated instantly with bold, statement shoes in a striking color or unique design. Conversely, when wearing patterned or colorful clothing, neutral shoes help maintain balance and prevent visual overload. Shoes also influence the formality and mood of an outfit, making them a key styling element. Investing in versatile footwear allows you to create multiple looks with minimal effort. This rule encourages intentional shoe choices that complement, rather than compete with, your outfit.",

    title: "Layering Colors",

      "Layering different shades of the same or similar colors adds depth and sophistication to an outfit. Instead of relying on contrast alone, this technique creates visual interest through gradual transitions in tone. Light, medium, and dark shades work together to form a cohesive and polished look. Layering colors is especially effective during cooler seasons when jackets, shirts, and outerwear are combined. Mixing textures alongside color variation enhances the overall effect. This rule helps create dimension without overwhelming the outfit, making it ideal for elegant and mature styling.",

    title: "Avoid Matching Too Much",
    description:
      "Wearing the exact same color from top to bottom can sometimes feel flat or overly coordinated. To avoid a monotonous look, it’s helpful to introduce contrast through accessories, textures, or slightly different shades. A belt, shoes, bag, or jewelry in a neutral or complementary color can break the uniformity and add interest. This rule encourages thoughtful variation while still maintaining cohesion. Small contrasts prevent outfits from looking costume-like and allow individual elements to stand out subtly. The goal is balance—coordinated but not overly matched.",
